                  Forming a consulting company with no consulting or programming experience was an interesting ride. We formed Alpha Centauri at the end of Team Week- the first week of the i.c.stars internship. Team week was focused on getting to know each other. We spent 11 hours a day with people we hardly knew. The only thing we did know was that we would be on teams with these people. Luckily, my team was Alpha Centauri.
